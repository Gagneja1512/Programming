Keep these things in mind when adding a solution :

* The folder structure must remain as follows:
<pre>
CP Solutions/
├─── Codeforces/
│       └─── 1599A.cpp     
└─── Codechef
</pre>

* Check if a problem is already present, before adding it.

* The first line of code must contain a link to corresponding question.

* The name of added file must be the problem code and it must added in the relevant folder(must be created if not already present).
